Inspiration: 
We students faced many challenges when learning turned from in-person to online. One of the main challenges students faced was how to take efficient notes. To combat this, we decided to create Wavey, your ultimate note-taking assistant. 

What it does: 
Wavey makes note-taking incredibly efficient by utilizing hand gestures to perform certain actions to aid students. For example, if a student were to hold up one finger on camera, the program would take a screenshot and record it onto a text file. In addition, if a student were to hold up two fingers on camera, it would simply take a screenshot and if a student were to hold up three fingers it would just record the information onto a text file. These three functions make note-taking incredibly efficient, simple and convenient for students!

How we built it: 
We used pycharm and vscode. In addition we used OCR through pytesseract, mediapipe, tkinter, pyautogui.

Challenges we ran into: 
This was our first time making a graphics user interface (GUI) using python, so that provided us with some difficulties. Also, we had some issues integrating the OCR, GUI and hand recognition. 

Accomplishments we are proud of: 
We are proud of our GUI, since it was our first time creating such a program. 

What we learned: 
We learned how to work with mediapipe and how to create a basic GUI with buttons. 

Whatâ€™s next for Wavey: 
We hope to alter our GUI to match our figma designs and also ironing out our screenshot size.
