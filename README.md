# Wavey

What it does: 
Wavey makes note-taking incredibly efficient by utilizing hand gestures to perform certain actions to aid students. For example, if a student were to hold up one finger on camera, the program would take a screenshot and record it onto a text file. In addition, if a student were to hold up two fingers on camera, it would simply take a screenshot and if a student were to hold up three fingers it would just record the information onto a text file. These three functions make note-taking incredibly efficient, simple and convenient for students!

## How we built it: 
- Python
- **Computer Vision** through `mediapipe`
- **OCR** through `pytesseract`
- **GUI**: `pyautogui`
- tkinter

## Inspiration: 
We students faced many challenges when learning turned from in-person to online. One of the main challenges students faced was how to take efficient notes. To combat this, we decided to create Wavey, your ultimate note-taking assistant. 

## Challenges we ran into: 
This was our first time making a graphics user interface (GUI) using Python, so that provided us with some difficulties. Also, we had some issues integrating the OCR, GUI and hand recognition. 

## Accomplishments we are proud of: 
We are proud of our GUI, since it was our first time creating such a program. 

## What we learned: 
We learned how to work with mediapipe and how to create a basic GUI with buttons. 

## Whatâ€™s next for Wavey: 
We hope to alter our GUI to match our figma designs and also ironing out our screenshot size.
